# Wordle is an online word-guessing game. The general idea is you have 6 guesses to guess a random 5 letter word, and each guess tells you which letters were and were not in the word. It is slightly more complex than that, and the rules (and the game itself) are available here: https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/.
The eventual objective of this project is to solve the puzzle in the least amount of guesses possible on average.
Project all in Python 3.10 using PyCharm.
